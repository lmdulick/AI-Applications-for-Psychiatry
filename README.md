# AI-Applications-for-Psychiatry
Taken Spring 2024

# Course Description
Honors Interdisciplinary Research & Signature Seminar Course

"Psychiatry grapples with complex challenges that arise from the intricacies of the human mind, requiring innovative computational analysis techniques to better understand and address these issues. This course will focus on ways in which AI can be used to understand the etiology of psychiatric conditions and predict their onset."

"Throughout the course, students will be introduced to a wide array of machine learning methods, tailored for analyzing medical data. This will include an exploration of both traditional machine learning techniques, advanced deep learning models, and generative AI technologies."

"In addition, a foundational understanding of neurobiology and clinical psychiatry will be offered to contextualize the computational techniques. Topics such as neural circuitry, neurotransmitter systems, and the psychological theories underpinning various psychiatric conditions will be covered, thereby bridging the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical AI applications in psychiatry."

"While a background in math or engineering is not obligatory, a comprehension of calculus and linear algebra will be useful."
